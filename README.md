## Features
###
* Users that sign up can access thier very own Zodiac information, and a variety of weekly and love-predicting horoscopes.
* A 3rd party API sends Zodiac information and horoscopes to the front end.
* Users interested in meeting other users can align and match with each other based on zodiac criteria, personal user dating preferences and more. 
* Accounts are matched and featured as compatability for the week.

## Stretch Goals and Major Hurdles

* Structuring a user model that matched dating preferences.
* Allowing users to message matched user accounts as a chat feature. This remains a goal to complete in the future as we dedicate additional time to this project.
* Passing params such as dates and IDs from the 3 Party API in fetch request and responses. 
* Connecting users as matches based on nested objects of matched IDs.
* Filtering user's dating interests and matches based on queries with matched zocdiac identificaiton and dating preferences.
